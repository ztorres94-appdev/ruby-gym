# Suppose that your program has to deal with the object inside the variable 'some_random_input'. If the object is:

# a String: downcase it and print it
# a Time: figure out the day of the week, downcased, and print
# an Integer: figure out whether it's odd or even and print
# a Symbol: downcase it and print it
# nil: print "no object provided"
# true: print "you may pass"
# false: print "you may not pass"
# a Hash: print the list of keys within the Hash, as an Array.

# if statements are one of our most commonly used tools we use as developers for dealing with the unknown!

# Next, remember that there's a method called `.class` that we can call on any Ruby object
#   to find out what kind of thing it is. We first met it way back in the Integer Chapter,
#   and we used it a lot especially when exploring an API response, which could come back to us in different shapes and sizes.
