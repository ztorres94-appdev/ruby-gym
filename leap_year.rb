# The program should:
#   Ask the user to input a year (Say 2016)
#   Determine if the given year is a leap year
#   If the given year is a leap year print, "2016 is a leap year!"
#   Otherwise print, "2015 is not a leap year."

# Hint:
#   To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:

#   1. If the year is divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
#   2. If the year is divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
#   3. If the year is divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
#   4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
#   5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
